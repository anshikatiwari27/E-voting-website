The e-voting project was developed using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. MySQL is used as the database for storing user and vote data.

The primary goal of this project is to overcome the conventional barriers associated with traditional voting systems. It empowers individuals to cast their votes online from their native locations, thus enhancing accessibility and convenience. This digital transformation not only automates the manual processes involved in voting but also significantly reduces paperwork, contributing to environmental sustainability.

Key features of the e-voting system include:

- User Authentication: Registered users can securely log in to the platform.
- Candidate Information: Users can view a comprehensive list of candidates.
- Electronic Voting: Users can cast their votes electronically with ease.
- Data Integrity and Accuracy: Votes are stored in a MySQL database, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the voting data.
- Administrative Functions: The system provides essential administrative functionalities for managing voters and candidates efficiently.

By integrating these features, the e-voting system ensures a seamless, secure, and efficient voting experience, paving the way for a more sustainable and accessible future in electoral processes.
